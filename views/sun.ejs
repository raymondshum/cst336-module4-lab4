  <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System, which all planets revolve around. The Sun is 330 thousand times larger than the Earth, with two-thirds of its mass being composed of hydrogen and one-third composed of helium. It generates sunlight through the fusion of hydrogen into helium.</p>
